Question 1:
No, this sequence cannot be referred to as correct. The reason for this is that it contains extra closing brackets ]] at the end, meaning that the brackets are not balanced.
Question 2: 
To change the sequence for it to be correct, we must replace the last ] with a closing bracket ) for balancing the brackets.
The properly corrected sequence will be:
(((()())(())))
Now every opening bracket ( has a paired closing bracket ) and the sequence is balanced.
